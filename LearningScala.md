# Learning Scala

From: [Scala Official Website](https://www.scala-lang.org/)

**Scala:** A programming language that scales with you: from small scripts to large multiplatform applications.

- **Expressive:** Scala lets you write less to do more. As a high-level language, its modern features increase productivity and lead to more readable code. With Scala, you can combine both functional and object-oriented programming styles to help structure programs.

- **Scalable:** Scala is well suited to building fast, concurrent, and distributed systems with its JVM, JavaScript and Native runtimes. Scala prioritises interoperability, giving easy access to many ecosystems of industry-proven libraries.

- **Safe:** Scala's static types help you to build safe systems by default. Smart built-in checks and actionable error messages, combined with thread-safe data structures and collections, prevent many tricky bugs before the program first runs.

- **Compatible:** Scala is compatible with Java, so you can use any Java library or framework from Scala. And you can use Scala from Java, so you can call Scala code from Java and pass data between the two.

### Proven Use Cases

**Server-side:** Creating Services
- High-throughput HTTP servers and clients. Safe, scalable, and principled concurrency. Reliable data validation with powerful transformations.

**Data Processing:** Processing Data
- Pick your favorite notebook. Run massively distributed big data pipelines; train NLP or ML models; perform numerical analysis; visualize data and more.

**Command Line:** Scripting Utilities
- Superpower your scripts with the Scala command. Get hands-on with the Scala Toolkit. Easily add libraries. Build CLI apps with instant startup.

**Frontend Web:** Fronend Web
- Reactive UI's backed by types. Use the same Scala libraries across the stack. Integrate with the JavaScript library and tooling ecosystem.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To install Scala, you need to have Java installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Scala from the [Scala Official Website](https://www.scala-lang.org/download/).

### Before we proceed...

**Question:** Do I need to know Java to learn Scala? In my case I already know Python.

**Answer:** No, you don't need to know Java to learn Scala, especially if you already have programming experience in Python. However, having a basic understanding of Java can be helpful because:

1. **Scala Runs on the JVM**: Scala is built on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and interoperates seamlessly with Java libraries. If you're working in a mixed Scala-Java environment or using Java-based libraries, knowing some Java basics might make integration easier.

2. **Syntax and Concepts**: While Scala is more expressive and concise than Java, its syntax is closer to Java than Python. For instance:
   - Scala uses curly braces (`{}`) and semicolons (though semicolons are optional).
   - Data types and object-oriented concepts in Scala may resemble Java more than Python.

3. **Ecosystem**: Many Scala tutorials and documentation reference Java concepts (e.g., JVM, classpaths, and Java collections). Understanding these can enhance your ability to navigate Scala resources.

That said, Python provides a solid foundation for learning Scala because:
- **Functional Programming**: Scala, like Python, supports functional programming paradigms (e.g., map, filter, and lambdas).
- **Dynamic Typing vs. Static Typing**: While Python is dynamically typed, Scala introduces you to static typing, but in a more developer-friendly way than Java.
- **Readability and Expressiveness**: If you appreciate Python's readability, you'll find Scala similarly expressive, though its syntax is more feature-rich.

If you decide to learn Scala without diving into Java, focus on:
1. **Scala Syntax**: Learn how Scala handles variables, data types, functions, and classes.
2. **Functional Programming**: Explore Scala's functional features like immutability, higher-order functions, and pattern matching.
3. **The JVM Ecosystem**: Familiarize yourself with the basics of the JVM, as it underpins Scala's execution.

To summarize: **Knowing Java isn't a prerequisite, but understanding its ecosystem can be beneficial in the long run.** Given your Python knowledge, you should be able to pick up Scala without much difficulty.

### Learn Scala

From the [Scala Official Website](https://docs.scala-lang.org/):

[Using the scala CLI](https://docs.scala-lang.org/getting-started/install-scala.html#using-the-scala-cli)

1. Hello World: `hello.scala`
2. Passing CLI arguments: `hello_arg.scala`
3. Using dependencies: `hello_deps.scala`

#### Using the REPL

1. You can start the Scala REPL by typing `scala` in your terminal.
2. To exit the REPL, type `:quit`.
3. To load a Scala script into the REPL, type `:load <filename>`.
4. To see the history of commands, use the up and down arrow keys.

```scala
println("Hello, Scala!")
```

```scala
val i = 10
println(s"Value of i: $i")
```

```scala
val i = 1
i + 4
```
